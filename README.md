# port-scanner
A beginner-friendly Python script that scans a target host for open ports.
This project demonstrates basic networking concepts like sockets and port scanning.



- **Port 3307** → often MySQL (database service)  
- **Port 5000** → common for Flask/Python web apps  
- **Port 6463** → used by Discord (local connections)  
- **Port 7000** → used by tools like Redis or custom servers

## 📚 What I Learned
- How port scanning works and why it matters in cybersecurity.
- How to use Python sockets to test network connectivity.
- The difference between open and closed ports, and how attackers/defenders both use scanners.

⚠️ Note: Port scanning should only be done on machines you own or have permission to test.
